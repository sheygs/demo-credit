### finpay

> A minimalist wallet system designed to simplify financial management.

### Objective

The system must be robust and secure against financial frauds and technical issues like race conditions and deadlocks.

### Technical Requirement

- Implement safeguards against race conditions, deadlocks, and ensure
  transactional integrity.

### Tasks

1. Core Wallet Functionality:

      - Create RESTful APIs for the wallet system that supports:

           - Crediting an amount to the wallet.
           - Debiting an amount from the wallet.

      - Ensure all operations are safe from race conditions and deadlocks.

2. Technical Documentation:

      - Document your code extensively.
      - Write a technical report detailing decisions taken during the design and
        implementation phases, including but not limited to:

           - Schema design.
           - Choice of libraries and frameworks.
           - Any patterns used for safe concurrency.
           - Security measures for financial transactions.

3. Admin Dashboard:

      - Develop an admin dashboard with capabilities to:

           - Manually credit or debit amounts to/from wallets.
           - View and export a weekly report analysis of transactions.

      - Include functionalities to seed data into the system for testing purposes.
